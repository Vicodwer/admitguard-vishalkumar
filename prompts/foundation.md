You are a senior full-stack developer expert in React and clean, professional internal business tools. Build a single-page React web application called "AdmitGuard" — a candidate admission data entry form with strong validation.
Must-have fields exactly in this order:
Full Name (text input)
Email (text)
Phone (text, label says "10-digit Indian mobile")
Date of Birth (date picker)
Highest Qualification (dropdown: B.Tech, B.E., B.Sc, BCA, M.Tech, M.Sc, MCA, MBA — default empty)
Graduation Year (number input)
Percentage or CGPA (number input + toggle/radio: "Percentage" vs "CGPA (10-point scale)")
Screening Test Score (number 0–100)
Interview Status (dropdown: Cleared, Waitlisted, Rejected)
Aadhaar Number (text)
Offer Letter Sent (Yes/No radio or toggle)
Use clean, modern card-based layout. Professional colors (blues/grays). Real-time inline validation messages below each field (red for errors). Submit button disabled until all strict rules pass.
Do NOT implement any validations yet — just perfect structure, labels, inputs, dropdowns, toggle for %/CGPA, and disabled submit button.
After building, show me the preview and explain the main component structure.
