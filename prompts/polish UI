You are a senior UI/UX designer and React developer polishing the AdmitGuard admission form app for a professional internal business presentation.
Current app state:
Clean card-based single-page React layout with form on main view and Audit Log tab/view
Professional blues/grays color scheme
Real-time validations (red strict errors, amber soft warnings), green checks when valid
Submit button (disabled until ready), success modal on submit
Active Exceptions counter and flag banner near submit
Audit Log table with columns (Name, Timestamp, Exceptions, Flagged, View Details button), modal for details, Clear Log button with confirmation
Now polish the UI for a clean, modern, professional look (aim for enterprise-tool feel: readable, spacious, subtle animations, good hierarchy). Prioritize these changes:
Form header: Make larger (24-32px), bold, centered, add subtle Futurense/IIT Gandhinagar logo placeholder (e.g., blue icon or text "AdmitGuard" with tagline "Admission Compliance System").
Increase spacing: Add more padding/margin between form fields (16-24px vertical), between sections, and around cards for breathing room.
Success/confirmation modal before submit: Add a pre-submit confirmation modal (trigger on submit click) showing summary: candidate name, exception count, flagged status, key fields — with "Confirm & Submit" / "Edit" buttons.
Animations: Subtle fade-in or scale when a field turns valid (green check appears), or success message fades in.
Table polish: In Audit Log view — striped rows (light gray alternate), hover effects on rows, better timestamp formatting (e.g., "Feb 27, 2026 7:15 PM"), make "View Details" button blue and prominent.
Overall: Ensure mobile-friendly if possible (responsive columns), add subtle box-shadows on cards, consistent button styles (rounded, hover states).
Dark mode toggle: Optional bonus — add a simple switch at top-right for light/dark theme (use CSS variables if easy).
Keep performance light (<3s load). Do NOT break functionality or change logic/validationRules.
After initial changes, prepare for Annotation Mode refinements — suggest specific elements I can highlight and describe next.
Generate updated code and show preview.
